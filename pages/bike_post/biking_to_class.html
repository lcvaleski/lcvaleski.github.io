        <h1>Biking to class from The Bronx to the UWS</h1>
        <img src="map.png" alt="Route" width="250">
        
        <p>Last semester, I registered for a class which took place at Fordham Lincoln Center, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. I chose to bike from my apartment at Fordham's Bronx campus (Belmont). It's a distance of about 10 miles.</p>
        
        <h2>The Bike</h2>
        <p>I met an old French guy in Brooklyn off of Facebook Marketplace who showed me an old Peugeot his son apparently didn't want. Per the recommendation of my calculus teacher, who I noticed biked from Harlem every day to class, I was looking for something with a low amount of gears, a steel frame, and low-cost:</p>
        
        <img src="bike.png" alt="Picture of the bike" width="400">
        
        <p>We reached a deal of $125, inclusive of a heavy duty chain lock (since been stolen when I briefly left it unlocked by itself outside).</p>
        <p>There are 5 speeds, operated by a vintage downtube shifter, a downward hand motion balancing act I came to enjoy as opposed to the modern handle attached shifters. The highest gear does not work, and I often came to class with gritty hands from putting the chain back on.</p>
        <p>I did not use clip ins, though that's my next upgrade.</p>
        <p>I eventually replaced the steel annoying chain with a Kryptonite u-lock that I mounted to the frame.</p>
        <p>IMO in NYC you shouldn't buy a nice bike. Go for a raw old one that gets the job done. Or be a Green Way sweat with a 2k Bianchi.</p>
        
        <h2>The Route</h2>
        <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12710457487">Detailed bike route with map</a>
        <p>On average, I made it to the UWS in about 48 minutes. The same for getting back.</p>
        <p>Getting out of The Bronx, and into Harlem, is an adrenaline rush. There are parts that felt like being at the whim of a drunk tuk-tuk driver in India. There are certain parts of The Bronx where the rules of the road no longer apply. Double-parked cars, mopeds and delivery drivers swooping in and out, all in one swelling road. The juxtaposition of this and, say, below Houston street is striking. Yet, I would say the flow you can attain in these more congested areas is where so much thrill and satisfaction happens. As the cars grid-lock, you get to pass through like water.</p>
        
        <p>Reaching the High Bridge is the main slice of heaven within the route, connecting The Bronx to Washington Heights, Manhattan. An old water tower sits perfectly middle-aligned in your vision as you bike across the bridge. The High Bridge is the oldest bridge in NYC, opened in 1848 as part of an aqueduct system.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; color: gray;">The High Bridge, NYC's oldest standing bridge, originally built in 1848 as part of the Croton Aqueduct.</p>

        <p>After this, I reached the Greenway, the long path along the Hudson with no cars. This was nice until they closed the entire stretch I was using for construction. I detoured to Riverside drive, one of the more beautiful roads with adjacently nice buildings in NYC.</p>
        
        <h2>Close Calls</h2>
        <p>Adrenaline rushes imply close calls. Often these weren't potentially deadly or even bone breakers, but more of a potential squeeze between a bus and car. I don't know what the outcome of those would be.</p>
        <p>Taxis do not seem to like bikers very much and we had a complicated relationship.</p>
        
        <h2>Biking in NYC</h2>
        <p>Biking in NYC allows you to see stuff that you can't on the subway or in a car, simple as that. I'm looking forward to this spring where I can go bike just for the sake of biking.</p>
        <p>I started to assemble and codify the patchwork of the streets, mentally, by taking things from different angles and directions on the bike. Biking in NYC increases your NYC literacy. I feel lucky to be living in a place where I can literally bike the whole thing in a day. What a thrill.</p>
