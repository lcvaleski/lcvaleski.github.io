        <h1>Boulder and Speculating on Its Future</h1>
        
        <p>Boulder, and particularly its location nestled right on the edge of the Rockies, was once described to me as a natural stepping stone. A place to rest before venturing further into the mountains and a place to return to from a pioneering standpoint. In my modern day life, this is exactly what Boulder has continued to be: a perpetual launching pad and place of return in between all of my travels.</p>

        <p>I'm speculating now about its future. When my parents moved in during the 80's, Boulder retained a great amount of its hippie base that still defines its identity today, although this has become more myth than reality. That being said, this identity is enough to describe and understand, an identity that I think up-and-coming places will ultimately struggle with (as seen already in Denver and to an extent the new ideal of Austin).</p>
        
        <p>A downside that has occurred over the years is with its massive influx of wealth (particularly from Tech), real estate has been driven up, far exceeding the value you get in square-footage in many people's opinions. Much like I'm familiar with in NYC, it gets to the point where you wonder "Is this exorbitant cost actually worth it?" While in NYC I think it's getting a little more suspect, I do think that Boulder retains its value, despite the rising costs.</p>
        
        <p>In such an individualistic place, although culturally and ethnically homogeneous, you get an incredible degree of individualism within Boulder's population, individualism that isn't constrained by the east coast extreme of uniformity and structure, nor the west coast ideal of hanging completely loose. Geographically central, Boulder's "vibe" isn't an extreme you find East, West, or South. It is simply weird and slightly undefined, slightly awkward, but somehow compelling to people who catch on. That being said, it is more of a natural place to understand coming from the West Coast than from the East.</p>

        <p>With Sundance arriving in 2027, I see this as the peak of the Boulder hype that it has found itself ensconced in. I do believe that this new exposure will drive prices up, and that this trend will not stop for a long time regardless of Sundance. The fear with this is when a place that is so truly special gets idealized as such, it drives a story about its appeal, attracting a herd of people that want to join but aren't the type that would have contributed to its organic growth in the first place.</p>

        <p>I do believe, however, that Boulder, sort of like the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, is something ancient that will renew itself, frozen in the type of person that it attracts, and spit out the people that it doesn't. Curious to check back in on this post after a decade.</p>
