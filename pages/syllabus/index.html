<p>Introduction to Art History: Asia</p>
<p>ARHI 1102 PW1</p>
<p>Summer 2025 (May 27-August 5)</p>
<p>Attribute: Global Studies and Fine Arts</p>
<p>Instructor: Dr. Asato Ikeda</p>
<p>Email address: <a
href="mailto:aikeda@fordham.edu">aikeda@fordham.edu</a></p>
<p><strong>Course</strong></p>
<p>This course offers a survey of Asian art spanning from ancient to
contemporary periods. It encompasses the exploration of arts and
monuments representing major religions, including Buddhism and Hinduism,
as well as the important visual traditions such as Chinese landscape
paintings, and Japanese woodblock prints. Utilizing critical art
historical scholarship, the course seeks to examine art through various
perspectives, including gender, sexuality, transcultural dialogues, and
diasporic experiences, while also confronting difficult histories,
including colonialism, racism, and war. </p>
<p><strong><u>There will be two 15–20 minute oral exams, scheduled
during Week 5 and Week 10 of the course</u>.</strong> The exact date and
time for each exam will be coordinated with the instructor, taking into
account the student's work and travel schedules to ensure flexibility
and accommodation.</p>
<p>Students will develop and be evaluated on four different skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Presenting visual analyses</p></li>
<li><p>Familiarity with important Asian art objects, artists, art
movements and historical chronology</p></li>
<li><p>Close and careful reading and understanding scholarship
(understanding historical context, theoretical concept and scholarly
arguments) and articulating and summarizing in an organized
manner</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>4) Managing time and following instructions: attending classes and
submitting</p>
<p>assignments on time</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Each week you are required to read assigned text and watch
assigned videos.</p></li>
<li><p>Each week you are required to submit a 15 min video.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each week, you will create a <strong>15-minute video</strong> in
which you present and reflect on that week’s assigned readings. This is
an important opportunity to develop your analytical thinking, speaking
skills, and personal engagement with the material. It will also serve as
practice for your midterm and final oral exams.</p>
<p>In your video each week, address the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Summary of Key Ideas (10 minutes):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Briefly summarize the main arguments or themes from the
readings.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify at least two key concepts or terms from the texts and
explain their significance.</p></li>
<li><p>When relevant, note the historical, cultural, or theoretical
context of the works.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Your Perspective (5 minutes):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What ideas did you find most compelling or challenging?
Why?</p></li>
<li><p>How do the readings connect to each other? Highlight tensions,
parallels, or questions they raise in conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer your own interpretation or critique, supported with
specific examples from the texts or real-world connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A quote you found particularly striking</p></li>
<li><p>A real-life connection (current events, personal experience,
other classes, etc.)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Video Guidelines</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your face must be visible</strong> for the entire
video.</p></li>
<li><p>You may use notes, but do not read from a script.</p></li>
<li><p>You may shoot multiple shorter videos that are 15 min in
total.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload your video to blackboard. You can upload your video on
Youtube (via your Fordham email) and make the videos unlisted so that
only I can access them. Share the link with me on Blackboard.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This format is designed to help you internalize course content,
articulate your thoughts clearly, and prepare you for the oral exams,
where you’ll be expected to discuss readings and present ideas without
written prompts.</p>
<p><mark>The videos are due at the end of the day (11:59 pm) every
Monday</mark>.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Students will complete two <mark>oral exams</mark> (Midterm in
Week 5, Final in Week 10), each lasting 15–20 minutes via video
conferencing. The exam will assess visual analysis, thematic discussion,
and comparative thinking. Students will analyze an artwork, respond to
thematic questions, and compare artistic elements. Evaluations will be
based on content accuracy, critical thinking, clarity, and engagement.
No external aids are allowed, and professionalism is expected.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The professor and students will work together to schedule exam slots
throughout the week to accommodate students who are traveling or
working, as well as the professor’s travel schedule/time difference.</p>
<p>Each exam will consist of five questions, which will be
<em>similar</em> to the following:</p>
<p>“Describe this artwork in terms of composition, style, and cultural
significance. How does it reflect the artistic traditions of its
time?”</p>
<p>“What are the key religious, social, or political influences behind
this artwork? How do these factors shape its meaning?”</p>
<p>“Compare and contrast two artworks from different regions or time
periods. How do their artistic techniques and themes differ?”</p>
<p>“Identify the main argument in a scholarly article we have read. What
evidence does the author use to support their claim?”</p>
<p>Please sign up for your oral exam spot by <mark>June 1.</mark></p>
